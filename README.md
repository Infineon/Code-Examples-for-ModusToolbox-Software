# Kits
We provide low-cost development kits for the PSoC™ 6 MCU platform.

[PSoC™ 6 Bluetooth® LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE)](http://www.cypress.com/cy8ckit-062-ble): The PSoC 6 Bluetooth® LE Pioneer Kit enables design and debug of the PSoC™ 63 Line. The kit includes an E-Ink display, and our industry-leading CAPSENSE™ technology.

[PSoC™ 6 Bluetooth® LE prototyping kit (CY8CPROTO-063-BLE)](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-ble-prototyping-kit-cy8cproto-063-ble): This is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC™ 6 MCUs. This kit is designed with a snap-away form-factor, allowing you to separate the KitProg (on-board programmer and debugger) from the target board and use independently.
