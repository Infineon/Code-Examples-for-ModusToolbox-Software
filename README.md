These examples demonstrate how to use ModusToolbox Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity libraries that are not tied to a specific cloud or device management solution. These include MQTT publisher and subscriber, OTA bootloading, and secure socket examples. |
|[Bluetooth SDK Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=mtb-example-btsdk%20NOT%20Deprecated)| This link finds all btsdk-related examples. |
| [Mbed OS Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=mbed-os-example%20NOT%20Deprecated) |This link displays a list of all Mbed-OS examples on the Cypress GitHub site, including CapSense, the emWin library, AWS IoT, and more.|
| [AWS IoT Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=afr-example%20NOT%20Deprecated) |This link displays a list of all Cypress Amazon FreeRTOS examples. In addition, the Amazon FreeRTOS repository [demo folder](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos/tree/master/demos) contains multiple examples, including additional AWS IoT examples. Some examples may not be supported on Cypress hardware. See the Getting Started guide for each board, available through the repository [ReadMe file](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos/blob/master/README.md).|

The AWS examples rely on the [AWS IoT Client Library](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/aws-iot). The examples will link to that library automatically.

# Kits
Cypress provides low-cost development kits for the PSoC 6 MCU platform.

[PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE)](http://www.cypress.com/cy8ckit-062-ble): The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit  enables design and debug of the PSoC 63 Line. The kit includes an E-Ink display, and Cypress' industry-leading CapSense® technology.

[PSoC 6 BLE Prototyping Kit (CY8CPROTO-063-BLE)](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-ble-prototyping-kit-cy8cproto-063-ble): a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC 6 MCUs. This kit is designed with a snap-away form-factor, allowing users to separate the KitProg (on-board programmer and debugger) from the target board and use independently.

[PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT)](http://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT): The PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit enables design and debug of the PSoC 62 MCU and the Murata LBEE5KL1DX Module (CYW4343W WiFi + Bluetooth Combo Chip). It includes a TFT display and Cypress' industry-leading CapSense technology.

[PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit (CY8CPROTO-062-4343W](http://www.cypress.com/cy8cproto-062-4343w) enables design and debug of PSoC 6 MCUs. It comes with industry-leading CapSense technology for touch buttons and slider, on-board debugger/programmer with KitProg3, μSD card interface, 512-Mb Quad-SPI NOR flash, PDM-PCM microphone, and a thermistor. It also includes a Murata LBEE5KL1DX module, based on the CYW4343W combo device.
